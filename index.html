   <h1>Hey!</h1>
</br>
<h2>
    I’m Delphine, a Confidence & Mindset Coach.
</h2>
<p>
    I help ambitious women rediscover themselves, start actually living instead of existing, and
become an ACTIVE participant to a life you love.
Because you absolutely deserve it. And the best bit is, your best chapter is just around the
corner. 
My mission is to empower you to dream big and to aim for the stars, be unapologetically
authentic, and show up for yourself to achieve your happiest, most confident self. I am here
to hold your hand every step of the way, and provide that safety net so you can:
build a stack of undeniable evidence           
develop a bulletproof mindset
fall in love with every aspect of your life
become UNSHAKEABLE
If you’re ready to step into your power, advocate for yourself with ease and grace, and build
stronger relationships with yourself and others, you have come to the right place.
